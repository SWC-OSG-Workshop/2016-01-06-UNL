<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the

  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>
  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>

      <h4 id="git-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>
  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <h3>Python</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>
    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all <a
href='http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility'>supported</a>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, 
  you will need working copies of the software described below.
  Please make sure to install everything
  (or at least to download the installers)
  <em>before</em> the start of your workshop.
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      Make sure you install, or have available, a text editor that
      you are comfortable with using.
      Since we will be using a remote shell for writing batch
      jobs, we encourage using an editor such as <code>nano</code>,
      <code>emacs</code> or <code>vi</code>.
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
      lets you track who made changes to what when and has
      options for easily updating a shared or public version of
      your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      We teach with Python version 2.7,
      since it is still the most widely used.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
    </p>

    <h4>Secure Shell & Secure Copy </h4>
    <p>
      <code>ssh</code> (secure shell) is an encrypted remote login tool. It lets you connect to remote resources, such as the OSG Connect login node and interact with the machine via UNIX shell.
      Similarly, <code>scp</code> (secure copy) is a tool that facilitates encrypted file transfer. We will use both to interact with OSG Connect.
    </p>

    <h4>OSG </h4>
    <p>
    If you do not have an account on the Open Science Grid, please 
    <a href="http://osgconnect.net/signup">Sign Up</a>. It takes 5-10 minutes 
 to complete the sign up process and about 30 minutes to get your account 
 activated.  
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <code>nano</code> is the editor installed by the Software Carpentry Installer,
      it is a basic editor integrated into the lesson material.
    </p>
    <h4>Git Bash</h4>
    <p>
      Install Git for Windows by download and running
      <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the installer</a>.
      This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
    </p>

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">

      installer <a href="https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list">available
      here</a>. Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow Leopard

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      Editors such as <code>nano</code> and <code>vim</code>
      are usually preinstalled. If you are unfamiliar with these, choose <code>nano</code>.
    </p>
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>,

      download the installer and we'll help you at the workshop.)
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Download the installer that matches your operating
        system and save it in your home folder.

      <li>
        Open a terminal window.

<h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

<p>
  As an alternative to the above, you can  use a virtual machine (VM)
  rather than install all the software above. To use a VM:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Download our <a href="https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B4Kr6DYkzkQtd05FekRId05DLXM&amp;export=download">VM image</a>.
    <strong>Warning:</strong>
    this file is 2.4 GByte,
    so please download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
  </li>
  <li>
    Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance"
    and loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>Check your setup</h2>

<p>
  To check you have the correct version of Python:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Download <a href="./setup/swc-installation-test-1.py">swc-installation-test-1.py</a>
